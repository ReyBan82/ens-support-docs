# DNS to ENS
## Overview and Implementation Guide

This site is dedicated to exploring the use of DNS domains within the blockchain and Ethereum ecosystem.

Traditional DNS domains do not work natively within the blockchain, however it is possible to "supercharge" a DNS domain name using the Ethereum Name Service(ENS) protocol as a bridge.

This site we will cover some basics of the Ethereum blockchain, smart contracts, current use cases of DNS within the blockchain, and how traditional domain name owners utilize this functionality today.

## DNS Compatibility with Blockchain

Traditional DNS domain names (e.g. `.com` `.org` `.xyz` etc..) are not natively be compatible with the blockchain. This is because the blockchain is built upon decentralized architecture whereas DNS relies upon centralized services and data storage.

Enabling forward-compatibility of domain names to the blockchain has many fascinating and practical use cases. The ENS protocol has been developing its own infrastructure that ensures legacy DNS domain names will forward with today's modern blockchain using the Ethereum ecosystem.

DNS domain owners can have the added benefit of blockchain functionality, without sacrificing how their domain names currently function on the Internet.
