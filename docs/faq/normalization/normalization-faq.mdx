# Normalization FAQ

## When will the new normalization rules be released?
There isn't an ETA on when the new normalization rules will be released and we cannot give rough estimates as it depends on
fluid circumstances where we may _think_ the rules are finalized, but then a new set of unicode conflicts are discovered which
pushes the time table back.

The normalization rules will be implemented as soon as it's possible to do so.

## What happens after the name normalization rules are finalized?
An `ENSIP` will be created and the `ENS DAO` will vote on whether to implement the rules or not.

## What happens to names made invalid under the new rules?
ENS names that becomes invalid under the new name normalization rules will have their registration fees refunded,
provided that the name was registered using the official ENS Manager App.

This will happen in a batch transaction sent automatically to affected users wallets and not on a case-by-case basis.
After the normalization rules have been released and we can determine which names have been made invalid, there'll be
a proposal in the `ENS DAO` to outline the details for the refund process.

:::caution
Invalid names registered by intentionally circumventing ENS normalization checks will likely _not_ have their registration fees refunded, such as:

 - Names registered by interacting directly with ENS smart contracts.
 - Names registered through a third-party service.

## I registered an invalid name and I can't manage it

:::caution
Invalid names cannot be managed or renewed using the official `ENS Manager App` and are entirely unsupported.
:::

:::info
Some third-party tools have limited functionality to manage them:

 - [ENS.Vision](https://ens.vision)
 - [Predomain](https://predomain.eth.limo)
:::

## Which characters will be allowed in the new normalization rules?

:::caution
The name normalization rules have not been finalized, which means that the rules can change due to emerging circumstances.

You can test characters and words against the _current draft_ of the name normalization rules by using raffy's resolver tool:
