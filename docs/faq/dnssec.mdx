# DNSSEC

## What is DNSSEC?

DNSSEC strengthens authentication in DNS using digital signatures based on public key cryptography. With DNSSEC, it's not DNS queries and responses themselves that are cryptographically signed, but rather DNS data itself is signed by the owner of the data.

## Pre-requisites for ENS
There are two pre-requisite steps to making a DNS name work with ENS:

The first step is to..
### Enable DNSSEC
   
Most registrars have some kind of interface for enabling it, but not all of them sets key types that ENS supports.
ENS supports two types of keys:
	
 - Elliptic Curve DSA keys usually referred to as just `ECDSA` keys, and
 - 256 bit Rivest-Shamir-Adelman / Secure Hash Algorithm `RSA/SHA-256` keys

Unfortunately not all registrars support DNSSEC, and some only support them as an additional paid service.
If your registrar does not support DNSSEC you'll need to switch to one that does.

### Recommended services
Here's a list of some popular services, and the key types they support.

If the registrar requires a manually set up of DNSSEC it's best to consult your registrars documentation or contact their customer service for help setting it up.

The second step is to..
### Create an _ens record

 - This record must be of the type `TXT`, in other words a text record
 - The record must be named underscore ens in lower capital letters
 - The record data must be lower case a equals the user's wallet address

All DNSSEC issues users have tend to be caused by these records either being set incorrectly, not having been propagated or their TLD not supporting DNSSEC.

## How to troubleshoot it

### Troubleshooting tools
The best ways to troubleshoot the records and the DNSSEC configuration is by using two tools:

:::info Google DNS DIG
 
 https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/

 This is Google's web frontend for an older unix utility named dig. It can be used to look up records for names very easily.
 If you run a unix-like operating system you can also use the terminal application dig if you'd like, which is much faster.

:::info DNSViz

 https://dnsviz.net/

 This is also a web front-end for an older unix utility named dnsviz. It's used to generate graphical visualizations of domain names, records all the way from the root zone to the TLD to the 2LD domain name itself.

 It's very useful to get a quick overview of what the issue is. Keep in mind that the warnings it shows don't always relate to what the issue with the DNSSEC configuration is for ENS.

## Common issues

### DNS Propagation delay
If you very recently made changes to your DNS name (such as creating the _ens record or enabling DNSSEC, or even registering the name itself)
and find that the manager app isn't recognizing it, the DNSSEC setup or the record it could be due to DNS propagation delay.

DNS changes are unfortunately not instant, and due to the way its designed it can take several hours before changes to a domain name is propagated
to all DNS servers on the internet.

Try waiting an hour or so, and see if it starts working. Technically speaking it can take up to 24 hours for DNS changes to propagate over the internet,
though in practice today it's usually propagated in under a few hours.

### Misnamed TXT-record
Make sure that the TXT-record is named just `_ens` (all lower cap letters) and contains the string **a=**`yourwalletaddress`

### Wrong DNSSEC key type
ENS supports `RSA/SHA-256` and `ECDSA` keys, make sure that DNSSEC for your domain is set up to use either of those two key types.

### DNSSEC Errors
DNSSEC is fairly complex to set up, and it's easy to make mistakes. Try taking a look at DNSViz to see if it shows any DNSSEC warnings.

### TLD doesn't support DNSSEC
_Some_ TLD's doesn't support DNSSEC which means that even if you set it up, it won't work.

### Registrar doesn't support DNSSEC for some TLD's
Some registrars support DNSSEC but only for _some_ TLD's. Make sure that it's supported for the TLD you're using.

#### Namecheap
Namecheap does not support managing DNSSEC under the following TLD's:  
`.africa` `.ai` `.cm` `.de` `.eu` `.nl` `.ph` `.sg` `.so` `.to` `.com.au` `.net.au` `.org.au`

### The domain name doesn't exist
Sometimes users try to import a domain name that doesn't exist into ENS, this doesn't work. The domain name must exist and be owned by the user importing it.
