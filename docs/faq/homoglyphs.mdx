# Homoglyphs
One of the things to watch out for when sending crypto to an ENS name, or buying and trading them, are
names with homoglyphs, meaning names that look identical or near-identical but are composed of different characters
than the common ones.

For example, `vita‍lik.eth` is not the same name as `vitalik.eth`.

Confusing? Let's look at what's going on behind the scene!

## Analyzing Unicode
:::info
In situations like this it's a good idea to use a unicode analyzer to take a deeper look at what the string of text
actually contains.

 - [Unicode Analyzer](https://www.fontspace.com/unicode/analyzer#e=dml0YeKAjWxpay5ldGg)
:::

When analyzing `vita‍lik.eth` with a unicode analyzer we get this:

_Click the Tab of each name to compare the two, can you spot the difference?_

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Real vitalik.eth" default>
    <BrowserWindow url="https://www.fontspace.com/unicode/analyzer">
      <p align="center">
        <div style={{'background-color': "#ffffff", 'padding': "25px"}}>
          <Image img="/img/faq/homoglyphs-analyze-1.png"/>
        </div>
      </p>
    </BrowserWindow>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Fake vitalik.eth">
    <BrowserWindow url="https://www.fontspace.com/unicode/analyzer">
      <p align="center">
        <div style={{'background-color': "#ffffff", 'padding': "25px"}}>
          <Image img="/img/faq/homoglyphs-analyze-2.png"/>
        </div>
      </p>
    </BrowserWindow>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When analyzing both ENS names one can see that one of the names is fake, containing an invisible character.
A so called `Zero-Width Joiner` or `ZJW`

## Zero-Width Joiners
Zero-Width Joiners are invisible characters intended to be used to glue emoji together to alter their properties.

Unfortunately, scammers have also used them to pass fake names off as real in order to trick people to send transactions to the wrong address, or to sell a fake name on secondary markets at a higher price to unsuspecting users.
