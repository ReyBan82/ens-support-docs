# Homoglyphs
One of the things to watch out for when sending crypto to an ENS name, or buying and trading them, are
names with homoglyphs, meaning names that look identical or near-identical but are composed of different characters
than the common ones.

For example, `vita‍lik.eth` is not the same name as `vitalik.eth`.

Confusing? Let's look at what's going on behind the scene!

## Analyzing Unicode
In situations like this it's a good idea to use a unicode analyzer to take a deeper look at what the string of text
actually contains.

 - [Unicode Analyzer](https://www.fontspace.com/unicode/analyzer#e=dml0YeKAjWxpay5ldGg)

When analyzing `vita‍lik.eth` with the unicode analyzer we get this:

<BrowserWindow url="https://www.fontspace.com/unicode/analyzer">
  <p align="center">
    <div style={{'background-color': "#ffffff", 'padding': "25px"}}>
      <Image img="/img/faq/homoglyphs-analyze-1.png"/>
    </div>
  </p>
