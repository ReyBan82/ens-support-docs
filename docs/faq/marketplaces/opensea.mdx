# OpenSea
OpenSea is a third-party marketplace run by a separate private company and is unaffiliated with Ethereum Name Service, as such we don't have any access to their systems to fix problems that are isolated to their platform.

## ENS name doesn't show
While ENS names appear and start working immediately in the ENS app, it can sometimes take a much longer time for them to show on third-party marketplaces because they only update their internal databases every once in a while.

When you're experiencing this issue the ENS names will show up either as a series of digits or as "Unknown ENS name". To fix this refresh the metadata:

## Refresh metadata
To schedule a refresh of your ENS Name's metadata in OpenSea, press the "three dots"-button and then `refresh metadata`:
<BrowserWindow url="opensea.io">
  <Image img="/img/faq/marketplaces/opensea-unknown-1.gif"/>
</BrowserWindow>

This schedules a refresh of the metadata in OpenSea's internal databases and usually resolves the issue in the next few hours.

:::note
If the ENS name still doesn't show up correctly after 24 hours you need to contact OpenSea's support for assistance, see [**OpenSea:** Support](#support)
:::

## OpenSea shows a "Delisted" notice
If the name does not exist at all on OpenSea, you will need to reach out to their [#Support](#support) to inquire why.

## OpenSea does not allow the name to be listed or sold
Be sure your name has a valid expiration date. ENS names that have expired are not able to be transferred (sold), or have any of their records updated. You would need to extend the name's registration in the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains).

## Support
If the problem isn't listed on this page or the solutions don't work OpenSea needs to be contacted directly:
