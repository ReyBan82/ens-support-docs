# Metamask mobile

Metamask mobile is a self-custody wallet for your mobile phone, which allows users to manage their own private keys to the wallet and any coins/tokens stored in it.

:::info
This app is not to be confused with the Metamask _browser extension_.

For help with the Metamask _browser extension_ see this [support page](/docs/faq/wallets/metamask).

## Clearing data in Metamask doesn't work
There is an [open issue](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/issues/2009) for Metamask Mobile where attempting to clear the cache, cookies or other data fail when the user tries to clear them in settings. The issue also causes cached pages to not be updated, leading to displaying old versions of dApps.
The only known solution is to either reinstall Metamask or to preferably to use a dedicated browser app. Brave, Chrome and Safari tend to work better than the built-in browsers within mobile wallet apps.
