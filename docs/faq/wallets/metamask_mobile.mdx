# Metamask mobile
## Clearing the cache, cookies or browser data in Metamask doesn't work
There is an [open issue](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/issues/2009) for Metamask Mobile where attempting to clear the cache, cookies or other data fail when the user tries to clear them in settings. The issue also causes cached pages to not be updated, leading to displaying old versions of dApps.
The only known solution is to either reinstall Metamask or to preferably to use a dedicated browser app. Brave, Chrome and Safari tend to work better than the built-in browsers within mobile wallet apps.
