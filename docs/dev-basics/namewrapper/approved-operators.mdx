description: Explaining the different operator approvals on the Name Wrapper contract

# Full-Control Operator Batch Approvals

Your wrapped name is an ERC-1155 NFT that supports the `setApprovalForAll` method. When you approve an address using this method, it will have **full control** over all wrapped ENS names that you own.

This method is typically used by NFT marketplace contracts.

# Name-Specific Subname Operator Approvals

The Name Wrapper also supports the ERC-721 `approve` method. This method is used to approve a single "Subname Operator" for a specific name.

The "Subname Operator" does not have full control over your wrapped name, it can only take actions on subnames:

* Create / Replace subnames
* Burn fuses on subnames
* Set / Extend the expiry on subnames

So for example, you can approve a subname registrar contract that can act on your behalf and allow users to register subnames.

Further, if you burn the **CANNOT_APPROVE** fuse on your name, then the approved subname operator can no longer be changed. You can use this to "lock in" a subname registrar, similar to how the .eth Registrar works.

And you can do all of this **without** needing to send your wrapped NFT to that contract.

This approved subname operator will be reset if the wrapped NFT is burned or re-minted, which happens if you unwrap the name, or if an expired name gets re-registered. It will also be reset if the wrapped NFT is transferred, **unless** the **CANNOT_APPROVE** fuse is burned.
