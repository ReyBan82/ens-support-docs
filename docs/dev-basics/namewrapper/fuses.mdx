# Fuses

A "fuse" is a permission or perk that can be granted/revoked on a name.
As the name implies, once the fuse is "burned", it cannot be unburned. Fuses will only reset when the **expiry** is reached.

There are **parent-controlled** and **owner-controlled** fuses:

## Parent-Controlled Fuses
Only the owner of the parent name can burn one of these fuses on a name. These can generally be thought of as "perks" that can be granted to a name, though they can be used in other ways.

| Fuse name | Description |
|-|-|
| **PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL** | Allows a parent owner to **Emancipate** a child name. After this is burned, the parent will no longer be able to burn any further fuses, and will no longer be able to replace/delete the child name. This fuse must be burned in order for any owner-controlled fuses to be burned on the name. |
| **IS_DOT_ETH** | This fuse cannot be burned by users of the Name Wrapper, it is only set internally when a .eth 2LD is wrapped. |
| **CAN_EXTEND_EXPIRY** | The owner of the child name will be able to extend their own expiry. Normally, only the parent owner can extend the expiry of a child name. See the <Link to="/docs/dev-basics/namewrapper/expiry">Expiry</Link> section for more information. |
| **Custom Fuses** | There are 13 other parent-controlled fuses that are not reserved, and can be used in any custom way you want! |

## Owner-Controlled Fuses
Either the owner of the name *or* the owner of the parent name can burn one of these fuses. These can generally be thought of as "permissions" that can be revoked on a name, though they can be used in other ways.

| Fuse name | Description |
|-|-|
| **CANNOT_UNWRAP** | The name will now be **Locked**, and can no longer be unwrapped. This fuse must be burned in order for any other owner-controlled fuses to be burned on the name. |
| **CANNOT_BURN_FUSES** | No further fuses can be burned on the name. |
| **CANNOT_TRANSFER** | The name (wrapped NFT) can no longer be transferred. |
| **CANNOT_SET_RESOLVER** | The resolver contract for the name can no longer be updated. |
| **CANNOT_SET_TTL** | The TTL for the name can no longer be updated. |
| **CANNOT_CREATE_SUBDOMAIN** | New subdomains can no longer be created. |
| **CANNOT_APPROVE** | The approved subname operator for the name can no longer be updated. See the <Link to="/docs/dev-basics/namewrapper/approved-operators">Approved Operators</Link> section for more information. |
| **Custom Fuses** | There are 9 other owner-controlled fuses that are not reserved, and can be used in any custom way you want! |
