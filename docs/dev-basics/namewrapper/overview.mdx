# Overview

The **Name Wrapper** is a new contract for ENS that allows you to "wrap" any ENS name into a ERC-1155 NFT.

Before the Name Wrapper, only .eth 2LDs (second-level domains, like `ens.eth`) had ERC-721 NFTs associated with them, unless the owner created a separate custom contract.

With this new contract, you can wrap:
* Any .eth name or subname
  * Examples: `name.eth`, `sub.name.eth`
* Any DNS name or subname
  * Examples: `name.com`, `sub.name.com`

Unwrapped .eth 2LDs have the concept of a separate Owner (Registrant) and Manager (Controller). This changes after you wrap the name, because there is only a single account that serves as both the Owner and Manager for the wrapped name.

## Wrapping and Unwrapping

When wrapping a .eth 2LD, you transfer the Owner (Registrant) of the ERC-721 NFT to the Name Wrapper contract. The contract will then automatically take over the Manager (Controller) for the name as well. You can do this by calling the <Link to="https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/wrapper#wrapeth2ld">`wrapETH2LD`</Link> method. Or, you can directly transfer the ERC-721 NFT to the Name Wrapper contract. In return, the contract issues you an ERC-1155 NFT.

When wrapping any other ENS name, you transfer the Manager (Controller) of the name to the Name Wrapper contract. You can do this by calling the <Link to="https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/wrapper#wrap">`wrap`</Link> method. In return, the contract issues you an ERC-1155 NFT.

As the owner of the wrapped name, you can unwrap at any time by calling either <Link to="https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/wrapper#unwrapeth2ld">`unwrapETH2LD`</Link> or <Link to="https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/wrapper#unwrap">`unwrap`</Link>. You can do this as long as the permission to unwrap has not been revoked.
