# Transfer an ENS name

In this tutorial you will learn how to transfer an ENS name to another wallet.

When transferring an ENS name, only the `Owner` record is automatically updated to reflect the new owner wallet.
Depending on your specific use-case it's therefore a good idea to take a moment and think about what additional records you want to transfer.

There are three records we need to pay attention to when transferring a name:

:::info
 1. **Owner:** *The owner of the ENS name, the wallet the ENS name NFT resides in.*
 1. **Manager:** *The manager of records, the wallet allowed to make changes to its records (but not transfer the name)*
 1. **ETH Address:** *The wallet address the ENS name points to, where funds sent to it will arrive.*

  <p align="center">
    <div style={{'background-color': "#f3f4f7", 'padding': "25px"}}>

    </div>
  </p>
</BrowserWindow>

## Completely transfer a name
If you want to completely transfer a name to a wallet you'll need to set three records to the new wallet in a specific order because only the wallet set as `Manager` is allowed to change the `ETH Address`.
:::info For example
 - If you were to change `Manager` first, you wouldn't be able to set the `ETH Address` without switching to the new wallet.
:::

In order to set everything to the new wallet easily from the wallet that currently owns the ENS name, you'd follow this specific order:

:::info Order
 1. **ETH Address:** *The wallet address the ENS name points to, where funds sent to it will arrive.*
 1. **Manager:** *The manager of records, the wallet allowed to make changes to its records (but not transfer the name)*
 1. **Owner:** *The owner of the ENS name, the wallet the ENS name NFT resides in.*

### Go to the Manager App
Go to the <Link to="https://app.ens.domains"><b>ENS Manager App</b></Link> with the wallet set as `Owner` & `Manager` for the ENS name you want to manage and click `Names` to bring up a list
of your ENS names *or* search for an ENS name you own directly from the main page.
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.ens.domains">
  <p align="center">
    <div style={{'background-color': "#f3f4f7", 'padding': "25px"}}>
      <Image img="/img/howto/v3-transfer-name-1.png"/>
    </div>
  </p>
</BrowserWindow>

Click the ENS name you want to transfer.
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.ens.domains">
  <p align="center">
    <div style={{'background-color': "#f3f4f7", 'padding': "25px"}}>
      <Image img="/img/howto/v3-transfer-name-2.png"/>
    </div>
  </p>
</BrowserWindow>

Go to the `More` tab.
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.ens.domains">
  <p align="center">
    <div style={{'background-color': "#f3f4f7", 'padding': "25px"}}>
      <Image img="/img/howto/v3-transfer-name-3.png"/>
    </div>
  </p>
</BrowserWindow>

Click `Send`.
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.ens.domains">
  <p align="center">
    <div style={{'background-color': "#f3f4f7", 'padding': "25px"}}>
      <Image img="/img/howto/v3-transfer-name-4.png"/>
    </div>
  </p>
</BrowserWindow>

When sending a name you have the optional ability to set the recipient as `Manager` of the ENS name.
:::info
1. `Owner` *The owner can send to a new owner and change the manager*
1. `Manager` *The manager can change and set records*
:::

Toggle the suitable options and click `Next`.
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.ens.domains">
  <p align="center">
    <div style={{'background-color': "#f3f4f7", 'padding': "25px"}}>
      <Image img="/img/howto/v3-transfer-name-5.png"/>
    </div>
  </p>
</BrowserWindow>

## Gift a Name with ENSFairy
If you would like to register a name on behalf of another wallet, <Link to="https://ensfairy.xyz"><b>ENSFairy</b></Link> is a great way to do that. This is because you can register a name with one wallet, but set up the ownership and address records to point to a different wallet.

<BrowserWindow url="ensfairy.xyz">
  <div style={{'background-color': "#f3f4f7"}}>
    <Image img="/img/howto/ensfairy-gifting.gif"/>
  </div>
</BrowserWindow>

:::info TIP
 If the ENS name recipient does not yet have a wallet address, the name can be sent to the ENSFairy vault for safekeeping. Read more here:
