# Add a Wallet Address
In this tutorial you will learn how to add a wallet address to your ENS name.

## What does it do?
Your ENS name is capable of storing a large number of wallet addresses across different blockchains, which can be added from the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains), allowing you to receive payments in more cryptocurrencies than just Ethereum, provided that the service or wallet used supports it.
