# Set a Primary name

The Primary name is your reverse record responsible for resolving your wallet address to your ENS name, effectively helping DApps and other services display your ENS name based on your *Ethereum* wallet address.

Setting a name as `Primary` in your wallet is usually a simple affair, but it can be a little complicated if:
 - The name was registered using a third-party service that didn't set the `Resolver` and `ETH Address` records by default.
 - The name was purchased on a secondary market and the `ETH Address` record is still set to the previous owner's wallet.

If either of these applies to you, then you can solve it by following the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section below.

## Prerequisites
:::info prerequisites
In order to set an ENS name as `Primary` there are two prerequisites:
1. The Resolver record must be set to the `ENS Public Resolver` smart contract.
1. The `ETH Address` record must be set to the wallet you're setting the `Primary` on.
:::

### 1. Set the Resolver
Go to your ENS name in the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains) and scroll down to the bottom and expand `Advanced settings`.
Make sure that the `Resolver` record there is set to either of these contract addresses:

:::info
 - The **new** ENS Public Resolver contract: `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63`
 - The **old** ENS Public Resolver contract: `0x4976fb03C32e5B8cfe2b6cCB31c09Ba78EBaBa41`  
   _the old ENS Public Resolver contract will continue to work and should not cause any issues._

  </div>
</BrowserWindow>

If it's unset edit it and enter the ENS Public Resolver: `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63`

### 2. Set the ETH Address record
Go to your ENS name in the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains) and scroll down to the `Addresses` section

<BrowserWindow url="https://app.ens.domains">
  <div style={{'background':'#f0f6fa'}}>
    <Image img="/img/howto/set-primary-name-ethaddress-1.png"/>
  </div>
</BrowserWindow>

Click `Add/Edit Record` and enter your wallet address into the `ETH Address` record field.

  <div style={{'background':'#f0f6fa'}}>
    <Image img="/img/howto/set-primary-name-ethaddress-2.png"/>
  </div>
</BrowserWindow>

Then **_scroll down_** and click `Confirm` _at the **bottom** of the address section_.

  </div>
</BrowserWindow>

## Set the Primary Name
:::caution Prerequisites
 - The ENS name must be configured with a `Resolver` record for the `Addresses`-section to appear.
 - The `ETH Address` record of the ENS name must first point to the wallet you want to set the `Primary Name` on

If either of these aren't set, please follow the instructions in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
:::

Go to the <Link to="https://app.ens.domains"><b>ENS Manager App</b></Link> and connect your wallet.

Click `My Account` on the upper right hand side to go to your Account page. Select an ENS name from the Primary drop-down list, click `Save` and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

## Verify that your Primary name works

Visit a few different services and verify that your `Primary name` is working correctly:

<Tabs>
