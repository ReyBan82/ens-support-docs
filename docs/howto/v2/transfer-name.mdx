# Transfer an ENS name
The owner of an ENS name is called the `Registrant` in the <Link to="https://app.ens.domains"><b>ENS Manager App</b></Link>. This is the wallet the ENS name NFT resides in.
In order to transfer an ENS name you must therefore transfer the `Registrant`.

However, an ENS name contains more records than just `Registrant` which can be set to different wallets. There are three central records involved in name transfers:

</BrowserWindow>

:::info
 1. **Registrant:** *The owner of the ENS name, the wallet the ENS name NFT resides in.*
 1. **Controller:** *The administrator of records, the wallet allowed to make changes to its records (but not transfer the name)*
 1. **ETH Address:** *The wallet address the ENS name points to, where funds sent to it will arrive.*
:::

When transferring an ENS name, only the `Registrant` record is automatically updated to reflect the new owner wallet.
Depending on your specific use-case it's therefore a good idea to take a moment and think about what additional records you want to transfer.

## Completely transfer a name
If you want to completely transfer a name to a wallet you'll need to set three records to the new wallet in a specific order because only the wallet set as `Controller` is allowed to change the `ETH Address`.
:::info For example
 - If you were to change `Controller` first, you wouldn't be able to set the `ETH Address` without switching to the new wallet.
:::

In order to set everything to the new wallet easily from the wallet that currently owns the ENS name, you'd follow this specific order:

:::info Order
 1. **ETH Address:** *The wallet address the ENS name points to, where funds sent to it will arrive.*
 1. **Controller:** *The administrator of records, the wallet allowed to make changes to its records (but not transfer the name)*
 1. **Registrant:** *The owner of the ENS name, the wallet the ENS name NFT resides in.*

## Gift a Name with ENSFairy
If you would like to register a name on behalf of another wallet, <Link to="https://ensfairy.xyz"><b>ENSFairy</b></Link> is a great way to do that. This is because you can register a name with one wallet, but set up the ownership and address records to point to a different wallet.
