## Step 1: Enable DNSSEC

Go to the <Link to="https://app.ens.domains"><b>ENS Manager App</b></Link> and search for your DNS name. You should see a screen like this:
<BrowserWindow url="app.ens.domains">
  <Image img="/img/howto/link-dns-name-1.webp"/>
</BrowserWindow>

If your DNS provider supports DNSSEC, all you do is enable the option in their DNS manager:
<BrowserWindow url="support.ensmods.xyz">
  <Image img="/img/howto/link-dns-name-2.webp"/>
</BrowserWindow>

If they don’t, you’ll need to migrate to a DNS provider that does. See:
> [**Hosting providers**](#hosting-providers)

## Step 2: Add the TXT-record
The DNS Registrar on ENS looks for a `TXT record` to verify ownership of the domain. This record has the following attributes:

:::info TXT record
|          |                    |
| -------- | -------------------|
| Type     | `TXT`              |
| Name     | `_ens`             |
| Contents | `a=wallet address` |
| TTL      | `36000`            |
:::

To prove ownership of your DNS name, create a `TXT record` in your DNS zone, _ens.yourdomain.xyz, with text data of the form `a=walletaddress`... where `walletaddress` is the Ethereum wallet you want to give control of the ENS record to.
<BrowserWindow url="support.ensmods.xyz">
  <Image img="/img/howto/link-dns-name-3.webp"/>
</BrowserWindow>

## Step 3: Linking the name with ENS
Now you should be able to go back to the <Link to="https://app.ens.domains"><b>ENS Manager App</b></Link> and finish linking the DNS name with ENS by pressing `Register`.
<BrowserWindow url="app.ens.domains">

</BrowserWindow>

## Troubleshooting

### I’ve updated the DNS records, but it’s not proceeding to the next steps.
It can take time for record changes in DNS to propagate throughout the Internet. If you are sure the records are set properly, try waiting for some amount of time and refreshing the DNS import page.

### I've set up DNSSEC but the ENS Manager App doesn't detect it
Use a [DNSSEC Analyzer tool](https://dnssec-debugger.verisignlabs.com/) to look for errors.
