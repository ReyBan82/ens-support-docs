# Set a Primary name
:::caution Pre-requisites
 - The `ETH Address` record of the ENS name must first point to the wallet you want to set the `Primary Name` on

If you haven't set the `ETH Address` record to your ENS name, see
 - <Link to="/docs/howto/add-wallet-address#eth-address"><b>How-To: </b>Add a Wallet Address <i>(ETH Address)</i></Link>
:::

Go to the <Link to="https://app.ens.domains"><b>ENS Manager App</b></Link> and connect your wallet.

Click `My Account` on the upper right hand side to go to your Account page. Select an ENS name from the Primary drop-down list, click `Save` and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

:::tip
If your ENS name doesn't show up in the Primary drop-down list, it's usually because the ENS name's `ETH Address` record doesn't point to your ENS name. To resolve it, see
 - <Link to="/docs/howto/add-wallet-address#eth-address"><b>How-To: </b>Add a Wallet Address</Link>
:::

## Verify that your Primary name works
Look up your wallet address on <Link to="https://etherscan.io"><b>Etherscan</b></Link> to check that the `Primary Name` works correctly.
