## What does it do?
The `ETH` Address record is one of the main records of your ENS name. It determines where Ethereum funds sent to it ends up, as well as providing the `forward resolution` required when setting up a <Link to="/docs/core/records/primary-name"><b>Primary name</b></Link>.

If you find that an ENS name you own doesn't show up in the Primary Name drop-down list for your wallet, it's usually because the `ETH Address` record isn't set to it.
