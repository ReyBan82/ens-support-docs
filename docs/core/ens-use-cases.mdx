# What can I use an ENS name for?

<br/>

## An easy to remember name for everything
The first and most common use case for an ENS name is to use it as an easy-to-remember name for your cryptocurrency addresses.
ENS supports many different cryptocurrencies which can be added from the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains), allowing you to receive payments in more cryptocurrencies than just Ethereum.

This alleviates the confusion associated with remembering your hexadecimal wallet address and provides easy payment options.

ENS names go far beyond that, however, allowing you to add all kinds of records to it from social media links, to profile pictures, custom records, and decentralized websites.
This gives you a name that can serve as your complete Web3 identity.

## Point to decentralized websites
By coupling your decentralized ENS name with a service for hosting decentralized websites, it's possible to have an entirely decentralized website suitable for Web3. The protocols currently supported are:
:::info Supported Protocols
 - **IPFS & IPNS**
